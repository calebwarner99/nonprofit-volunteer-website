# nonprofit-volunteer-website
Java Spring Boot website created in summer 2021 for the TechPoint Summer Challenge. The website is designed to give volunteers the best options for volunteer work based on given criteria and data collected from non-profits. It is no longer operational, but is here to showcase my programming abilities.
